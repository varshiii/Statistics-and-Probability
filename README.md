# 📊 Statistics and Probability Notes
## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains detailed notes on Statistics and Probability, essential topics in data science and analytics. These notes are part of my ongoing 30-day learning challenge, aimed at enhancing my understanding of foundational concepts and their applications in data analysis.
## 📄 What's Included?
1. **Data Types:**
Numeric Data: Continuous and Discrete data types.
Categorical Data: Binary and Ordinal data.
2. **Rectangular Data:**
Explanation of data frames, features, records, and outcomes in the context of statistical and machine learning models.
3. **Estimates of Location:**
Concepts of mean, weighted mean, trimmed mean, and median.
Explanation of percentiles, outliers, and robust statistics.
4. **Estimates of Variability:**
Metrics like variance, standard deviation, and mean absolute deviation.
Understanding the interquartile range and how variability affects data interpretation.
5. **Exploring Data Distribution:**
Visual methods: boxplots, histograms, and density plots.
How to explore binary and categorical data using mode, bar charts, and pie charts.
6. **Correlation and Multivariate Analysis:**
Understanding correlation, scatter plots, correlation coefficients, and correlation matrices.
Introduction to contingency tables and advanced visualizations like hexagonal binning and violin plots.
7. **Sampling and Resampling:**
Concepts of random sampling, stratified sampling, sample bias, and the difference between population and sample means.
Explanation of bootstrapping and its use in estimating sampling distributions.
8. **Standard Error and Variance:**
Differences between standard deviation and standard error.
Introduction to the bootstrap method for estimating standard errors and confidence intervals.

## 🔍 Future Updates
I plan to expand these notes in future updates to include more detailed case studies, practical examples, and code snippets for applying these concepts in Python.
